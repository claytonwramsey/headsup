# HEADSUP Localization Data

This folder contains data collected in order to verify efficacy of our localization system. The file names are named as tests_angle_distance.csv, where angle is the direction of the sound impulse measured relative to the front of the helmet and distance is the radial
distance of the impulse from the helmet. Each row of the CSV files starts with the angle and distance of the test. The following eight entries are the times that microphones 0, 1, ..., 7 picked up the sound impulse. The final entry is the calculated direction of the sound impulse measured from the right side of the helmet (the usual mathematical convention if the helmet is superimposed on the xy plane with the front of the helmet pointing in the positive y direction).
